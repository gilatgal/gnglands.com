# Refund and Returns Policy

Our refund and returns policy lasts 90 days on all terms purchases. If 90 days have passed since your purchase, we canâ€™t offer you a full refund or exchange.

There is no refund nor exchange on Cash sales.

To complete your return, we require a receipt or proof of purchase, as well as a written email stating you request a refund or an exchange.

## Refunds

Refunds may take 5-10 business days to appear on your bank statements.

If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment.

## Exchanges

We will exchange your property with a different one as long as it is on a payment plan. Once we transfer the deed to your name, we will not be able to exchange your property.
